Management of an engineering project from conceptualization to delivery.

The use of mobile phones and tablets has become very ubiquitous these days, not only for voice
communications, but also for Internet access. People expect to use these devices in any location, regardless of
where they are, which imposes challenges to many organisations. Cruise ships are among the “special”
locations that need to accommodate communication capabilities for passengers, namely mobile cellular
communications and Wi-Fi. For the former, there are international operators that are licenced to provide
services when the ships are cruising at sea, but not on ports, where interference with local operators would
create problems; these international operators also provide the Wi-Fi service on board. The communications
in between the ship and the “outside world” are done via satellite systems.

The project is the installation of cellular communications base stations and Wi-Fi access points in a cruise ship
for an international operator. We play the role of Project Leader from the Project Development Department of the operator.
